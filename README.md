# Guitar-Simulation
This project aims to simulate an acoustic guitar through the implementation of the Karplus-Strong (KS) Algorithm.

Further information on this project can be found in the file *'Final Version of Simple Electronic Guitar Project Report.pdf'*

The folder *'Old Computer Version'* contains the original computer version of the project.  Run the file *'Computer_Version_of_ElectronicGuitarTest.py'* on a computer with all the required Python modules preinstalled in order to test the program.

The folder *'New Computer Version'* is a new experimental computer version of the project.
This folder also features sample audio outputs in the form of .wav files. Run the file *'Computer_Version_of_ElectronicGuitarTest.py'* on a computer with all the required Python modules preinstalled in order to test the program.


The folder *'Raspberry Pi Version Final Project'* Features the hardware based implementation of the project which would have been used with the physical model had it been completed. This early version of the hardware code was handled by Jihang Xie. It also featured a real-time plot of the audio output which would be visualized on the touchscreen display mounted on the guitar. Run the file *'ElectronicGuitaTest1.py'* on a Raspberry Pi with all the required Python modules preinstalled in order to test the program. *Version 0* features only the KS algorithm implementation. *Version 1* features KS and Vibrato Effect. *Version 2* features, KS, Vibrato as well as the ability to play multiple notes at once.
